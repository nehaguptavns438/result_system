            century BCE, and it is debatable whether it could be regarded a university or not in modern sense, since teachers living
            there may not have had official membership of particular colleges, and there did not seem to have existed purpose-built
            lecture halls and residential quarters in Taxila, in contrast to the later Nalanda university in eastern India. Nalanda
            was the oldest university-system of education in the world in the modern sense of university. There all subjects were
            taught in Ariano -PÃ¡li language</p>
